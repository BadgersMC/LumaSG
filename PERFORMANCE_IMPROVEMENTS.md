# LumaSG Performance Improvements & Code Quality Enhancements

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive performance improvements and code complexity reductions implemented to address the 45 Lizard warnings and enhance overall system performance.

## ðŸš€ Performance Improvements Implemented

### 1. Caffeine Caching System (High Priority)

#### SkinCache (src/main/java/net/lumalyte/util/SkinCache.java)
- **Purpose**: Reduces API calls for player skin data
- **Cache Configuration**: 
  - Maximum size: 1,000 entries
  - Expiration: 6 hours after write
  - Statistics tracking enabled
- **Benefits**: 
  - Eliminates repeated Mojang API calls
  - Improves GUI loading performance
  - Reduces network latency impact

#### PlayerDataCache (src/main/java/net/lumalyte/util/PlayerDataCache.java)
- **Purpose**: Caches frequently accessed player data
- **Cache Types**:
  - Player Statistics (500 entries, 30min write/15min access expiration)
  - Permission Cache (1,000 entries, 10min expiration)
  - Display Names (1,000 entries, 30min expiration)
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduces database queries
  - Faster permission checks
  - Improved game performance

### 2. ExpiringMap Integration (Medium Priority)

#### InvitationManager (src/main/java/net/lumalyte/util/InvitationManager.java)
- **Purpose**: Automatic cleanup of expired team invitations
- **Configuration**:
  - Expiration: 30 seconds after creation
  - Maximum size: 1,000 invitations
  - Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks
- **Benefits**:
  - Eliminates manual cleanup tasks
  - Prevents memory accumulation
  - Improved invitation system reliability

### 3. Cache Integration Points

#### Plugin Initialization (src/main/java/net/lumalyte/LumaSG.java)
- Added `initializeCachingSystems()` method
- Initializes all caching systems during plugin startup
- Proper error handling and logging

#### Player Join Optimization (src/main/java/net/lumalyte/listeners/PlayerListener.java)
- Added `preloadPlayerCaches()` method
- Preloads essential data when players join
- Improves initial game experience

## ðŸ§¹ Code Complexity Reductions

### 1. Arena Configuration Loading Refactoring

#### Problem: Arena::loadFromConfig (Cyclomatic Complexity: 19 â†’ ~6)
**File**: `src/main/java/net/lumalyte/arena/Arena.java`

**Before**: Single monolithic method with nested conditions
**After**: Broken into focused methods:
- `validateAndGetArenaName()` - Input validation
- `createArenaFromConfig()` - Basic arena creation
- `loadAllArenaData()` - Orchestrates data loading
- `loadArenaLocationsFromConfig()` - Location-specific loading
- `loadCenterLocationFromConfig()` - Center location loading
- `loadSpawnPointsFromConfig()` - Spawn point loading
- `loadChestLocationsFromConfig()` - Chest location loading
- `loadLobbySpawnFromConfig()` - Lobby spawn loading
- `loadSpectatorSpawnFromConfig()` - Spectator spawn loading
- `loadArenaBlocksFromConfig()` - Allowed blocks loading
- `loadArenaPropertiesFromConfig()` - General properties
- `validateArenaConfiguration()` - Final validation

**Benefits**:
- Each method has single responsibility
- Easier to test and maintain
- Reduced cognitive complexity
- Better error isolation

### 2. Enchantment Application Refactoring

#### Problem: ItemUtils::applyEnchantments (Cyclomatic Complexity: 12 â†’ ~4)
**File**: `src/main/java/net/lumalyte/util/ItemUtils.java`

**Before**: Complex method handling both stored and regular enchantments
**After**: Broken into focused methods:
- `applyStoredEnchantments()` - Handles enchanted book enchantments
- `addStoredEnchantment()` - Adds single stored enchantment
- `applyRegularEnchantments()` - Handles regular item enchantments
- `addRegularEnchantment()` - Adds single regular enchantment
- `getEnchantmentFromRegistry()` - Registry access helper

**Benefits**:
- Separation of concerns
- Reusable helper methods
- Easier debugging
- Consistent error handling

## ðŸ“Š Expected Performance Impact

### Memory Usage
- **Reduced**: Fewer database queries and API calls
- **Controlled**: Cache size limits prevent memory leaks
- **Optimized**: Automatic expiration prevents stale data accumulation

### CPU Usage
- **Reduced**: Cached permission checks eliminate repeated calculations
- **Optimized**: Asynchronous loading prevents main thread blocking
- **Improved**: Better algorithm complexity in refactored methods

### Network Impact
- **Significantly Reduced**: Skin API calls cached for 6 hours
- **Minimized**: Database connection overhead reduced
- **Optimized**: Bulk operations where possible

### User Experience
- **Faster**: GUI loading with cached skin data
- **Smoother**: Reduced lag from permission checks
- **Responsive**: Asynchronous operations prevent blocking

## ðŸ”§ Dependencies Added

### build.gradle
```gradle
// Caching
implementation 'com.github.ben-manes.caffeine:caffeine:3.1.8'
implementation 'net.jodah:expiringmap:0.5.11'
```

**Security**: All dependencies verified with Trivy scanner - no vulnerabilities found.

## ðŸ“ˆ Monitoring & Statistics

### Cache Statistics Access
- `SkinCache.getCacheStats()` - Skin cache hit rates and sizes
- `PlayerDataCache.getCacheStats()` - Player data cache statistics
- `InvitationManager.getStats()` - Invitation system statistics

### Recommended Monitoring
- Monitor cache hit rates (target >80% for optimal performance)
- Track memory usage of cache systems
- Monitor database query reduction
- Measure GUI loading time improvements

## ðŸŽ¯ Remaining Optimization Opportunities

### Large Files to Consider Refactoring
1. **SGCommand.java** (933 lines) - Could be split into subcommands
2. **Game.java** (816 lines) - Could extract game phases into separate classes
3. **GameCelebrationManager.java** (735 lines) - Could split celebration types
4. **AirdropBehavior.java** (590 lines) - Could extract airdrop phases
5. **GamePlayerManager.java** (572 lines) - Could separate player operations

### High Complexity Methods Still Remaining
1. **TeamSelectionMenu anonymous method** (CC: 17) - GUI callback complexity
2. **GameWorldManager::removeAllBarrierBlocks** (CC: 14) - Block iteration logic
3. **StatisticsDatabase::getColumnNameForStatType** (CC: 12) - Switch statement
