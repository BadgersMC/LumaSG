- **Blocking Coefficient**: 4.0 (I/O wait time / CPU service time)
- **Safety Bounds**: 2-16 threads (configurable)

**Examples for Different Server Configurations**:

| Server Type | CPU Cores | Calculation | Result | Actual Threads |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| Budget VPS | 1 core | 1 Ã— 0.75 Ã— 5 = 3.75 | 4 threads | 4 threads |
| Standard VPS | 2 cores | 2 Ã— 0.75 Ã— 5 = 7.5 | 8 threads | 8 threads |
| Game Server | 4 cores | 4 Ã— 0.75 Ã— 5 = 15 | 15 threads | 15 threads |
| Dedicated | 8 cores | 8 Ã— 0.75 Ã— 5 = 30 | 16 threads* | 16 threads |
| High-End | 16 cores | 16 Ã— 0.75 Ã— 5 = 60 | 16 threads* | 16 threads |

*\*Capped by MAX_THREADS safety limit*

**Configuration Override** (config.yml):
```yaml
performance:
  chest-filling:
    thread-pool-size: 0  # 0 = auto-calculate, >0 = manual override
    min-threads: 2
    max-threads: 16
    target-cpu-utilization: 0.75
    blocking-coefficient: 4.0
```

- **Trade-off**: Memory for CPU performance (worthwhile for concurrent games)
- **Configurable limits**: All caches have maximum size limits

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Performance Statistics
The system provides comprehensive performance monitoring:

```java
// Get current thread pool statistics
String stats = ConcurrentChestFiller.getPerformanceStats();

// Check current configuration
int threadCount = ConcurrentChestFiller.getCurrentThreadPoolSize();
boolean autoCalc = ConcurrentChestFiller.isUsingAutoCalculation();
```

### Logging Output
```
[LumaSG] ConcurrentChestFiller initialized:
[LumaSG]   âœ“ Adaptive thread pool with 8 threads (auto-calculated)

[LumaSG]   âœ“ I/O optimized for chest filling operations
```

## Recommendations

### For Server Administrators
1. **Monitor Performance**: Check logs for thread pool sizing information
2. **Adjust if Needed**: Use config.yml to override automatic calculations
3. **Start Conservative**: Begin with auto-calculation, adjust based on monitoring
4. **Consider Hardware**: Ensure adequate RAM for caching systems

### For Developers
1. **Thread Safety**: All new systems are thread-safe by design
2. **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup in shutdown methods
3. **Monitoring**: Use built-in performance statistics for debugging
4. **Configuration**: Allow administrators to tune performance settings

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- **Dynamic thread pool adjustment** based on load

- **JVM heap optimization** for cache efficiency
- **Integration with server monitoring tools**

### Performance Targets
- **Target**: Support 30+ concurrent games on high-end hardware
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance metrics dashboard
- **Optimization**: Continuous profiling and tuning

## Conclusion

These optimizations transform LumaSG from a single-game plugin into a high-performance system capable of handling 15-20 concurrent games efficiently. The adaptive thread pool sizing ensures optimal resource utilization across different server configurations while maintaining safety bounds to prevent system overload.

The key innovation is the **resource-aware adaptive sizing** that automatically scales thread allocation based on server capabilities, eliminating the need for manual tuning while providing override capabilities for advanced users.
