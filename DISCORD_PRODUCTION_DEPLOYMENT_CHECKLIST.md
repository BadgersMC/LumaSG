## Monitoring Setup

### Health Monitoring
Set up regular monitoring:
```bash
# Add to server monitoring script
/sg debug discord-health
```

### Performance Monitoring
Monitor these metrics:
- Memory usage
- Message queue size
- Connection status
- Error rates
- Response times

### Log Monitoring
Monitor logs for these patterns:
- `[DiscordIntegration] ERROR` - Integration errors
- `[DiscordConnection] WARN` - Connection issues
- `[DiscordSecurity] WARN` - Security issues
- `[DiscordPerformance] INFO` - Performance metrics

## Maintenance Procedures

### Regular Maintenance
- **Daily**: Check Discord integration status
- **Weekly**: Review performance metrics and optimize if needed
- **Monthly**: Review audit logs and security events

### Maintenance Commands
```bash
# Check status
/sg debug discord-status

# Optimize performance
/sg debug discord-optimize

# Full health check
/sg debug discord-health

# Validate configuration
/sg debug discord-validate
```

### Update Procedures
1. Test updates in development environment first
2. Backup current configuration
3. Apply updates during low-traffic periods
4. Verify functionality after updates
5. Monitor for issues post-update

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Bot Not Responding
**Symptoms**: No Discord responses, commands don't work
**Diagnosis**: 
```bash
/sg debug discord-status
/sg debug discord-health
```
**Solutions**:
1. Check bot token validity
2. Verify bot permissions
3. Restart integration: `/sg reload`
4. Check Discord server status

#### Issue: Missing Announcements
**Symptoms**: Games start but no Discord messages
**Diagnosis**:
```bash
/sg debug discord-validate
```
**Solutions**:
1. Verify channel IDs are correct
2. Check bot permissions in channels
3. Verify announcement features are enabled
4. Check webhook configuration

#### Issue: Performance Problems
**Symptoms**: Slow responses, high memory usage
**Diagnosis**:
```bash
/sg debug discord-performance
```
**Solutions**:
1. Run performance optimization: `/sg debug discord-optimize`
2. Check server resources
3. Review configuration settings
4. Consider reducing announcement frequency

#### Issue: Permission Errors
**Symptoms**: "Insufficient permissions" errors
**Diagnosis**: Check Discord bot permissions
**Solutions**:
1. Verify bot has required permissions
2. Check role hierarchy in Discord
3. Review permission configuration
4. Re-invite bot with correct permissions

### Emergency Procedures

#### Disable Integration Quickly
```yaml
discord:
  enabled: false
```
Then: `/sg reload`

#### Reset Connection
```bash
/sg reload
```

#### Clear Performance Issues
```bash
/sg debug discord-optimize
```

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Performance
- **Memory Usage**: < 50MB additional
- **Message Processing**: < 100ms average
- **Connection Latency**: < 500ms to Discord
- **Error Rate**: < 1% of operations

### Performance Thresholds
- **Warning**: Memory > 100MB, Latency > 1000ms
- **Critical**: Memory > 200MB, Latency > 2000ms, Error rate > 5%

## Security Considerations

### Production Security
- [ ] Bot token stored securely (not in version control)
- [ ] Admin channels restricted to authorized users
- [ ] Regular security audits of permissions
- [ ] Monitor for unauthorized access attempts
- [ ] Keep Discord bot permissions minimal

### Audit Requirements
- All admin commands are logged
- Security events are tracked
- Failed authentication attempts recorded
- Regular audit log reviews

## Backup and Recovery

### Configuration Backup
- Backup `config.yml` regularly
- Store bot token securely separate from config
- Document channel IDs and webhook URLs
- Keep record of Discord server setup

### Recovery Procedures
1. Restore configuration from backup
2. Verify bot token is still valid
3. Check Discord server permissions
4. Test functionality after recovery
5. Monitor for issues
