# LumaSG Statistics System Implementation Summary

## Overview

The LumaSG plugin now includes a comprehensive statistics system that tracks player performance across all Survival Games matches. This implementation fulfills **Phase 1** of the project roadmap and addresses the critical missing data persistence layer.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Core Statistics Classes

#### `PlayerStats.java`
- Comprehensive data model for player statistics
- Fields: wins, losses, kills, deaths, games played, time played, damage, chests opened, etc.
- Calculated properties: K/D ratio, win rate, top 3 rate, average kills per game
- Increment methods for easy statistics updates

#### `StatType.java`
- Enumeration of different statistic types for leaderboards
- Supports: WINS, KILLS, GAMES_PLAYED, KILL_DEATH_RATIO, WIN_RATE, TIME_PLAYED, etc.

#### `StatisticsDatabase.java`
- SQLite database implementation with async operations
- Thread-safe design using ExecutorService
- CRUD operations for player statistics
- Leaderboard queries with sorting and limits
- Database maintenance and optimization features

#### `StatisticsManager.java`
- Main interface between game system and database
- In-memory caching for performance
- Async statistics loading and saving
- Periodic save system to prevent data loss
- Methods for recording various game events

### 2. Integration Points

#### Main Plugin (`LumaSG.java`)
- StatisticsManager initialization and shutdown
- Integrated into plugin lifecycle
- Proper cleanup on plugin disable

#### Player Events (`PlayerListener.java`)
- Statistics preloading on player join
- Death recording
- Damage tracking (dealt and taken)
- Player quit handling with cache cleanup

#### Chest Events (`ChestListener.java`)
- Chest opening statistics tracking
- Only counts unique chest openings per game

#### Game Logic (`Game.java`)
- Game result recording at game end
- Player placement calculation
- Kill statistics tracking
- Game duration measurement

#### Leaderboard GUI (`LeaderboardMenu.java`)
- Complete rewrite from placeholder implementation
- Real-time data loading from database
- Interactive tabs for different statistic types
- Loading states and error handling
- Formatted display of player statistics

### 3. Configuration

#### `config.yml` additions:
```yaml
statistics:
  enabled: true
  save-interval-seconds: 300  # 5 minutes
  preload-on-join: true
  track-damage: true
  track-chests: true

debug:
  enabled: false  # Changed from true to false
```

## Features

### Statistics Tracked
- **Game Results**: Wins, losses, games played
- **Combat**: Kills, deaths, damage dealt/taken
- **Performance**: Best placement, win streaks, top 3 finishes
- **Activity**: Chests opened, time played
- **Calculated**: K/D ratio, win rate, average performance metrics

### Leaderboard System
- **Interactive GUI**: Tabbed interface with kills, wins, and games played
- **Real-time Updates**: Async loading with loading indicators
- **Rich Display**: Player rankings with comprehensive statistics
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback for database errors

### Technical Features
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking database operations
- **Caching System**: In-memory cache for frequently accessed data
- **Periodic Saves**: Automatic saving of pending statistics
- **Thread Safety**: Concurrent data structures and proper synchronization
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and connection pooling

## Database Schema

The SQLite database includes a comprehensive `player_stats` table with:
- Player identification (UUID, name)
- Game statistics (wins, losses, kills, deaths, games played)
- Performance metrics (best placement, win streaks, top 3 finishes)
- Activity data (time played, chests opened, damage statistics)
- Timestamps (first joined, last played, last updated)

## Performance Considerations

- **Async Design**: All database operations are non-blocking
- **Caching**: Frequently accessed statistics are cached in memory
- **Batch Operations**: Periodic saves reduce database load
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connection management
- **Thread Safety**: Concurrent access handling without locks where possible

## Configuration Options

The system is fully configurable through the main config.yml:
- Enable/disable statistics tracking
- Adjust save intervals
- Control what statistics are tracked
- Debug logging options

## Future Enhancements

The implementation provides a solid foundation for:
- Additional statistic types
- Historical data tracking
- Advanced leaderboard filtering
- Export/import functionality
- Web dashboard integration
- Achievement systems

## Conclusion

The statistics system implementation successfully addresses the critical data persistence issues identified in Phase 1 of the project roadmap. The system is production-ready, performant, and provides a comprehensive foundation for player engagement and server analytics.
